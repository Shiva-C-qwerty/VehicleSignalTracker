# VehicleSignalTracker

**Description:**
VehicleSignalTracker is a Node.js application designed to track and monitor vehicles' signals and provide essential notifications to enhance driver safety and convenience. The application utilizes sensor data and location services to automatically determine the location of the user's vehicle and continuously checks for nearby vehicles in close proximity. Whenever another vehicle is detected within a specified range, the user is promptly notified, allowing them to stay aware of potential hazards and take appropriate precautions for safer driving.

Additionally, VehicleSignalTracker includes a fuel monitoring feature. The application keeps track of the user's vehicle's fuel level and sends notifications when it is running low. Moreover, it provides real-time guidance to the nearest fuel station, helping the user locate and navigate to the most convenient refueling point. By leveraging GPS data and intelligent algorithms, VehicleSignalTracker ensures that users can proactively manage their vehicle's fuel needs, avoid running out of fuel, and maintain a smooth and uninterrupted driving experience.
